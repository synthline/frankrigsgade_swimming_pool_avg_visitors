# frankrigsgade_swimmingpool_avg_visitors

This simple program checks every 5 min.(whilst the swimming pool is open) the number of visitors in the swimminghall on Frankrigsgade and tries to infer statistics, in order to determine what would be the best time to go for a swim (in other words, what is the time spot during the week with the least visitors?).
It uses [selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/) for retrieving the data, thus it is a prerequisite to have it if you want to use it.

## v.1.0 - not finished yet
This ensures basic functionality of retrieving data during open hours and start storing data.
